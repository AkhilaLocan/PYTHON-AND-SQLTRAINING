# SQL Training Session 


## SQL Concepts Reviewed

- DDL: create tables, databases, modify columns
- DML: insert, truncate, delete, update
- DQL: select, filter, aggregate data

## Constraints & Keys

- NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT constraints explained
- PRIMARY KEY: single per table, uniquely identifies rows
- FOREIGN KEY: relates tables, can have many per table
- Composite primary key possible, but still only one primary key definition

## Query Techniques

- SELECT \* vs. selecting specific columns
- DISTINCT for unique values
- WHERE clause for row‑level filtering
- LIMIT to restrict result count
- ORDER BY ASC/DESC for sorting

## Wildcards & Pattern Matching

- % matches any sequence of characters
- \_ matches a single character position
- Used with LIKE in WHERE conditions for start, end, or middle patterns

## NULL Handling

- IS NULL and IS NOT NULL to include/exclude missing values
- Nulls affect ML model training; replace or filter as needed
- Example: rental records with null return date indicate unreturned items

## GROUP BY & HAVING

- GROUP BY aggregates rows by one or more columns
- HAVING filters aggregated results (e.g., totals &gt; 100)
- Alias columns with AS for readability, but use original column names in HAVING

## Order of Execution

- Execution flow: **FROM → JOIN → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY → LIMIT**
- Understanding this order prevents alias‑related errors in HAVING
