# SQL Built-in Functions

- Functions are pre‑written; no custom code needed.
- Used for filtering, transforming, and formatting data at the SELECT level.
- Common categories: string, numeric, date/time, and regex functions.

## String Manipulation Functions

- **Padding**: LPAD, RPAD add spaces or characters to reach a target length (e.g., make titles 20 chars).
- **Substring**: SUBSTRING(col, start, length) extracts a portion of a string; start index is 1‑based in SQL.
- **Concatenation**: CONCAT(col1, col2, ...) joins strings; useful for building emails or custom IDs.
- **Reverse**: REVERSE(col) flips the character order.
- **Length**: LENGTH(col) returns character count; often used in WHERE clauses.
- **Replace**: REPLACE(col, 'A', 'X') swaps characters or patterns.

## Position & Pattern Functions

- **LOCATE**: finds the position of a character/sub‑string (e.g., locate '@' in email).
- **SUBSTRING_INDEX**: splits a string at a delimiter and returns the part before/after it.
- **CASE**: conditional logic in SELECT – CASE WHEN condition THEN value ELSE other END.
- **REGEXP**: regular‑expression matching for dynamic pattern filtering (e.g., exclude three consecutive vowels).

## Regex & Dynamic Queries

- Regex enables fully dynamic text filters without hard‑coding positions.
- Example: WHERE last_name REGEXP '^\[^aeiou\]{3}$' finds names without three consecutive vowels.
- Use ^ for start, $ for end, \[\] for character sets, and !/^ inside brackets for negation.
- Regex is also applied in Python scripts for PDF data extraction (OCR + pattern matching).

## Numeric & Date/Time Functions

- **Power**: POWER(col, n) raises a number to the n‑th power.
- **Floor / Ceil**: round down (FLOOR) or up (CEIL) numeric results.
- **Random**: RAND() generates a float 0‑1; combine with FLOOR(RAND()\*100) for integers.
- **Casting**: CAST(col AS DECIMAL(6,2)) changes data type; may behave differently across MySQL vs. other SQL dialects.
- **Date Diff**: DATEDIFF(date1, date2) returns days between dates.
- **Extracting Parts**: YEAR(col), MONTH(col), DAYNAME(col), etc., for calendar analysis.

## Grouping & Aggregation

- Use GROUP BY on derived columns (e.g., LEFT(title, 2)) to count occurrences of similar prefixes/suffixes.
- Aggregates: COUNT, SUM, AVG combined with GROUP BY for per‑customer or per‑day metrics.
- Remember execution order: FROM → WHERE → SELECT; aliasing columns in SELECT cannot be used in the same SELECT’s WHERE clause.
